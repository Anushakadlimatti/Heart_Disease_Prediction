# Heart_Disease_Prediction

This project aims in predicting the health of person's heart. Based on some of the features like age, angina, chest_pain, etc.., this project predicts if the persons's heart is defective or healthy one. 

Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. 
Machine learning (ML) proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry.
The dataset I have used is Heart disease prediction dataset from Kaggle. It has some 13 features like age, chest pain, cholesterol, angina, etc.., from which the heart disease can be predicted.
In this project, I have used Linear Regression to predict the heart_disease.
